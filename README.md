# Hi, I'm Alex 👋

### What I build
Tools for the AI-assisted future. Systems that compose. Infrastructure that doesn't surprise you.

### The shape of things
Started in embedded systems, moved through iOS, went deep on FP, now building AI/ML infrastructure. The common thread: systems where correctness matters.

### Focus areas
- **Functional Programming** — Scala, Haskell, Rust
- **AI/ML Infrastructure** — LLM tooling, embeddings, agent systems
- **Nix** — Reproducible builds, declarative everything
- **Distributed Systems** — When state, failure, and latency all matter

### Open source
