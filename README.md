# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex

### 🛠️ What I build

Tools for the AI-assisted future. Systems that compose. Infrastructure that doesn't surprise you.

I care about **correctness**, **reproducibility**, and building things that last.

---

### 📐 The shape of things

Started in **embedded systems** — where every byte matters and bugs crash hardware, not just processes.

Moved through **iOS** — mobile at scale, real users, real constraints.

Went deep on **functional programming** — type systems as documentation, composition as architecture, reasoning about code without running it.

Now building **AI/ML infrastructure** — because the same principles that make distributed systems reliable apply to making LLMs useful.

The common thread: **systems where correctness matters**.

### 🎯 Focus areas

| Area | What I find interesting |
|------|------------------------|
| **λ Functional Programming** | Scala, Haskell, Rust — type-level programming, effect systems, algebraic abstractions |
| **🤖 AI/ML Infrastructure** | LLM tooling, embeddings, agent systems, making AI useful in production |
| **❄️ Nix** | Reproducible builds, declarative environments, never "works on my machine" again |
| **🌐 Distributed Systems** | Consensus, state replication, failure modes, latency budgeting |

### 🔓 Open source

I contribute to tools that help developers be more effective.

- **[infiniloom](https://github.com/Topos-Labs/infiniloom)** — High-performance repository context generator for LLMs. Transform codebases into optimized formats for Claude, GPT-4/5, Gemini.

- More projects at **[Topos Labs](https://github.com/Topos-Labs)** — AI research & development.

### 💭 What I believe

- **Correctness over convenience** — The easy path is rarely the right path
- **Composition over inheritance** — Build small things that combine well
- **Explicit over implicit** — Magic is great until it isn't
- **Delete more than you add** — Simplicity is a feature
